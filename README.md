# The worlds first container network manager
Development is a work in progress, please follow us on social media for updates (socials are in the footer of our website)
  
## Why Use SkiffUI
SkiffUI provides the first easy to use, Drag-and-Drop user interface for modifying, or networking containers after creation. SkiffUI currently supports only Docker but could easily be expanded to interact with Docker Swarms and Kubernetes clusters later on.

## How it works
SkiffUI interacts with docker by converting graphical node data into commands for your container service, these commands are then executed as root on the host.

## Future plans for SkiffUI
- Integration with Kubernetes
- Integration with Docker Swarm
- GUI based container generator (drag software into container from a toolbox to generate a docker image)
- Remote system connection via SSH
